Logo Design.

Hi everyone,

As the title may suggest I need a logo for the software, the blue circle with the letters 'BU' inside which is currently in use is very ugly and doesn't do anyones eyes any good.

The logo would be used as the program icon and must be 64x64
and will also be used on the up & coming website (banner size may vary)

I'm not much of a designer myself so I would like to ask if anyone can come up with a better one I would love to use your work. Your name will be added to the Project people list, and will also be added to the 'About' box in the software itself.

However I wont just pick the first logo which I receive :) I will choose the top 5, and when the new website is up & running, I will post the top 5 logos which people can vote on. The winner will then be chosen on a date not yet known.

Thanks very much for reading, I appreciate any help from everyone.
